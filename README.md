# mojob-job-feed

## The task

We would like you to:
* fetch job listings and display them in a job feed
* create a location filter.

All job listings and all job locations can be fetched from our public API.

## The API documentation
https://test-api.mojob.io/public/docs/

You do not need to authorize to use those endpoints.

To test an endpoint you can click on the endpoint, then click "Try it out", then scroll a bit down and click the blue "Execute" button.

We would like you to try to make it look like the given design.

## Design



## What we expect

* Read through entire README.md before delivering
* Code that works
  - After you have delivered your finished project we are able to run your code.
  - We prioritize functionality and readable code before looks, but our UI/UX designer will be very pleased if the outcome looks similar to the given design.
* Framework
  - We encourage you to use the given Vue project template, but we will rate all submissions equally. The most important thing is that we can run your code easily.
  - You are allowed to use different technologies like Angular or React.
* Language
  - We encourage you to use Typescript, but Javascript is also allowed.

## Node + NPM versions
```
Node v12.19.0 (npm v6.14.8)
```

It might be necessary for you to use this version in order to get
this project to install and run properly.

We use [node version manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to quickly change node versions. If you are not able to use `nvm` you can either install this specific Node version or you can create a new project with [vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create) with the Node+NPM-version of your choice.

Remember to let us know at the bottom of this README.md before delivering your project what you chose.

## Project setup

### Command to install dependencies
```
npm install
```
### Command to run the development server
```
npm run serve
```

## Comments

* Use the tools and framework you are comfortable with. 
* After you have delivered your project we will read the code and run the project. 
* We have estimated this task to take 1-2 hours, but you can spend as much time as you like.
