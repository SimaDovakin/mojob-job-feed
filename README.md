# mojob-job-feed

### The task

We would like you to use our public test-api to fetch job listings and
display these job listings in a job feed. We would also like you to create
a location filter.

All job locations and all job listings can be fetched from our public API.

See documentation of the endpoint here:

https://test-api.mojob.io/public/docs/

You do not need to authorize in order to use those endpoints.

To test an endpoint you can click on the endpoint,
then click "Try it out", then scroll a bit down and click the blue
"execute" button.

We would like you to try to make it look like on the given design.

### Design



### What we expect

* Read through entire README.md before delivering
* Code that works
  - We expect that after you have delivered your finished project we are able
    to run your code.
  - We prioritize functionality and readable code before looks, but our UI/UX designer
    will be very pleased if the outcome looks similar to the given design.
* Framework
  - We encourage you to use the given vue project template, but we will rate all
    submissions equally. The most important thing is that we can run your code easily.
  - You are allowed to use different javascript libraries like Angular and React.
* Language
  - We encourage you to use the typescript, but javascript is also allowed.

### Node + NPM versions
```
Node v12.19.0 (npm v6.14.8)
```

It might be necessary for you to use these version in order to get
this project to install and run properly.

We use [node version manager(nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to
quickly change node versions. If you are not able to use nvm
you can either install this specific node version or you can
create a new project with [vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create)
with the Node+NPM-version of your choice.

Remember to let us know at the bottom of this README.md before delivering your project
what you chose.

### Project setup

#### Command to install dependencies
```
npm install
```
#### Command to run development server
```
npm run serve
```

### Comments

* Use the tools and framework you are comfortable with. 
* After you have delivered your project we will read the code and run the project. 
* We have estimated this task to take 1-2 hours, but you can spend as much time as you like.
